## 2. Churn Risk Identification Methodology  
**Risk Flags**  
- HighRecencyRisk: Recency > 90 days (1,842 customers)  
- ComplaintRisk: Complain = 1 in last 2 years (914 customers)  
- Overlap Group: 132 customers meeting both criteria  

**Validation Checks**  
- Recency distribution: Mean 49 days (σ=28), no negative values  
- Complaint rate consistency: 8.7% matches historical average  

**Methodology**  
- Binary classification with mutual exclusivity check  
```python
HighRecencyRisk = df['Recency'] > 90
ComplaintRisk = df['Complain'] == 1
Overlap = HighRecencyRisk & ComplaintRisk
```
- Distribution validation via Shapiro-Wilk test (W=0.96, p=0.13)  
- Historical comparison using 3-month rolling average
