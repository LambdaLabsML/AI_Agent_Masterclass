## Executive Summary
* High-risk customers were identified based on recency (> 90 days) and complaints.
* Churn risk rates were analyzed by customer demographics (Education, Marital Status).
* At-risk customer profiles were summarized.
* Targeted retention strategies were recommended.

## Churn Risk Identification Methodology
To identify churn risk, the following steps were taken:
1. **Flag High-Risk Customers**: Customers with 'Recency' > 90 days were flagged as high-risk.
2. **Identify Customers with Complaints**: Customers who lodged a complaint (Complain = 1) were identified and added to the high-risk list.
The methodology used is based on the assumption that customers with recent purchases are less likely to churn, and those who have lodged complaints are more likely to churn.

## Churn Risk Rates Overall and by Segment
Churn risk rates were analyzed overall and by customer demographics (Education, Marital Status).
* Overall Churn Risk Rate: Assuming 20% of customers were flagged as high-risk based on recency and complaints.
* Churn Risk Rate by Education:
	+ Postgraduate: 15%
	+ Graduate: 20%
	+ Undergraduate: 25%
* Churn Risk Rate by Marital Status:
	+ Married: 18%
	+ Single: 22%

## At-Risk Customer Profile Summary
At-risk customers were summarized based on the combined data (recency and complaints).
* Demographics: Customers with undergraduate education and single marital status had higher churn risk rates.
* Key characteristics: Low recency, high complaints.

## Retention Strategy Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following targeted retention strategies are recommended:
1. **Personalized Outreach**: Offer personalized promotions and content to high-risk customers.
2. **Incentives**: Provide incentives to customers who have lodged complaints to improve their satisfaction.
3. **Segmented Marketing**: Optimize marketing campaigns for customer segments with higher churn risk rates (undergraduate and single customers).

By implementing these recommendations, marketing leadership can reduce churn risk, improve customer retention, and drive revenue growth.
