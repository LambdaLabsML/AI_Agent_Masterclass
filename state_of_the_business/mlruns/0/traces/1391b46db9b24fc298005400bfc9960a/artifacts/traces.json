This step is crucial for accessing the sales data.\\n\\n2. **Data Validation and Cleaning**: Validate the data for accuracy and completeness. Check for missing values, data types, and ensure the data is up-to-date. Clean the data if necessary by handling missing values, correcting data types, etc.\\n\\n3. **Filter Data for 03 2025**: Filter the sales data to only include records for March 2025. This involves selecting rows where the date falls within the March 2025 timeframe.\\n\\n4. **Calculate Key Performance Metrics**:\\n   - **Total Revenue**: Sum the total sales revenue for March 2025.\\n   - **Number of Orders**: Count the total number of orders in March 2025.\\n   - **Average Order Value (AOV)**: Calculate AOV by dividing the total revenue by the number of orders.\\n   - **Customer Acquisition**: Determine the number of new customers acquired in March 2025 by analyzing customer IDs or relevant data points.\\n   - **Conversion Rate**: Calculate the conversion rate by dividing the number of orders by the total number of visitors or leads, depending on the available data.\\n\\n5. **Identify Top-Selling Products**: Analyze the sales data to identify the top 5 best-selling products in March 2025 based on units sold and revenue generated.\\n\\n6. **Month-over-Month Performance Comparison**: Compare the key performance metrics (total revenue, number of orders, AOV, customer acquisition) for March 2025 with the previous month (February 2025) to identify month-over-month changes.\\n\\n7. **Analyze Notable Trends or Anomalies**: Examine the data for any notable patterns or anomalies in sales trends, customer acquisition, or product performance.\\n\\n8. **Prepare the Structured Markdown Report**:\\n   - **Executive Summary**: Summarize the key findings in 3-5 bullet points.\\n   - **Key Metrics Table**: Create a table to display revenue, orders, AOV, customer acquisition, and conversion rate for March 2025.\\n   - **Top 5 Best-Selling Products**: List the top 5 products with their units sold and revenue generated.\\n   - **Month-over-Month Performance Comparison**: Present the comparison of key metrics with February 2025.\\n   - **Notable Trends or Anomalies**: Briefly analyze any identified trends or anomalies.\\n   - **Recommendations**: Provide recommendations based on the analysis, if applicable.\\n\\n9. **Methodology Section for Each Part**: For each section of the report, include a methodology subsection that details:\\n   - The methodology used for analysis.\\n   - Key calculations and formulas applied.\\n   - Reasoning behind conclusions drawn.\\n   - Supporting data points and metrics.\\n   - Any assumptions made during analysis.\\n   - Data validation steps taken.\\n   - Statistical significance of trends identified.\\n\\n10. **Finalize the Report**: Compile all the sections into a comprehensive markdown report.\\n\\nThe final answer is:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"list_of_plans_per_task\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"task\\\": \\\"Analyze the ecommerce (B2C) sales data for 03 2025 in the dataset: /app/state_of_the_business/datasets/spaceoutfitters_sales.csv\\\",\\n      \\\"plan\\\": \\\"1.
